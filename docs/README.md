# Documentation Index & Finalization Notes

**Last validated:** 2026-04-29 (UTC)
**Scope:** `docs/` handover, readiness reports, and backend contracts.

## Canonical documents

1. **`BE-REST-API-Requirement.md`**  
   Backend implementation contract (full platform) and the main source of truth for API behavior, including lore metadata, field notes, observations, and image/video/file documentation attachments.

2. **`production-readiness-chat-plan.md`**  
   Detailed production-gap analysis and phased chat hardening roadmap.

3. **`full-platform-readiness-assessment-2026-04-27.md`**  
   Platform-wide readiness snapshot for demo vs production.

4. **`chat-readiness-assessment-2026-04-27.md`**  
   Chat-module readiness snapshot.

5. **`functionality_test.md`**  
   Functional QA run summary (tests/lint/build) used by the readiness docs.

## Document status

- `backend-requirements-full-platform-2026-04-27.md` is retained as an **earlier baseline draft** for historical context.
- New implementation work should reference **`BE-REST-API-Requirement.md`** first, then `production-readiness-chat-plan.md` for chat-specific rollout strategy.

## Validation performed for finalization

- Verified all files in `docs/` are readable and structurally complete (no TODO placeholders).
- Aligned canonical reference flow so there is one primary backend contract plus supporting assessments.
- Fixed invalid companion-doc reference in backend contract (see update in `BE-REST-API-Requirement.md`).
- Added current Author Panel coverage for lore field notes, observations, and uploaded attachment badge/delete behavior.

## Maintenance rule

When updating architecture or API behavior:
1. Update `BE-REST-API-Requirement.md` first.
2. Reflect impact in `production-readiness-chat-plan.md`.
3. Refresh dated readiness reports only when a new validation run is executed.
