## Chat Backend Handover Specification (for BE Developer)

**Product:** Morneven Institute Website  
**Module:** Chat  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-27 (UTC)  
**Document status:** ✅ Handover-ready (implementation baseline)  
**Primary FE reference:** `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`, `src/services/chatApi.ts`

---

## 0) Purpose of this document

This document is the **single handover contract** for backend implementation of Chat.

It defines:
1. what FE behavior must be preserved,
2. required API + DB contracts,
3. authorization rules,
4. real-time/event requirements,
5. acceptance criteria and definition of done.

If BE proposes deviations, record them in a decision log before implementation.

---

## 1) Scope

### In scope (must deliver)
- Direct Message (DM)
- Manual Group conversations
- System-managed conversations (`team`, `division`, `institute`)
- Membership invite/accept/reject
- Roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`)
- Kick / leave / role change
- Message send/delete
- Reply snapshot support
- Attachment upload lifecycle
- Real-time updates
- PL7 and institute automation rules
- Audit logs for privileged actions

### Out of scope (this phase)
- Message edit history UI
- E2EE
- Voice/video
- Typing indicators
- Reactions

---

## 2) FE behavior parity requirements

Backend must preserve these FE-visible behaviors:

1. Conversation kinds:
   - `dm`, `group`, `team`, `division`, `institute`
2. Membership status:
   - `active`, `invited`, `removed`
3. Roles:
   - `owner`, `admin`, `member`
4. Permissions:
   - Sender delete own message
   - Owner/Admin can moderation-delete
   - Owner/Admin invite members (non-system conversations)
   - Owner-only role transfer/escalation
5. Reply preview:
   - Reply stores snapshot (author/text/hasAttachments), not live pointer only
6. System-managed constraints:
   - `team/division/institute` cannot be renamed by user-level actions

---

## 3) Non-functional requirements (target SLO)

- Availability: **99.9%** monthly
- API p95 latency:
  - send message < 300ms
  - list conversations < 500ms
  - load messages page < 700ms
- Concurrent real-time connections: minimum **5,000**
- Data consistency: membership/role updates are strongly consistent
- Recovery: daily backup + PITR restore capability

---

## 4) Canonical data model

> Suggested SQL model (PostgreSQL). Types can be adapted, semantics cannot.

### 4.1 users
- `id (uuid, pk)`
- `username (text, unique, not null)`
- `email (citext, unique, not null)`
- `status (text: active|inactive|suspended)`
- `personnel_level (int)`
- `track (text: executive|field|mechanic|logistics)`

### 4.2 conversations
- `id (uuid, pk)`
- `kind (text: dm|group|team|division|institute)`
- `name (text, not null)`
- `created_by (uuid fk users.id)`

---

## 5) Authorization contract (mandatory)

| Action | Who can do it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Create DM | Authenticated user | Ensures exactly 2 participants |
| Create group | Authenticated user | Creator becomes owner |
| Invite member | Owner/Admin | Non-system conversations only |
| Accept invite | Invitee | status invited → active |
| Reject invite | Invitee | remove pending invite |
| Kick member | Owner/Admin | Admin cannot kick admin/owner |
| Change role | Owner only | Includes transfer owner |
| Leave conversation | Active member | Owner handoff required if owner leaves |
| Rename conversation | Owner/Admin | Non-system only |
| Send message | Active member | |
| Delete own message | Sender | soft delete |
| Moderation delete | Owner/Admin | audit required |

All authorization MUST be server-side and independent from FE checks.

---

## 6) API contract (v1)

```

---

## 7) Error contract (standardized)

Error format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "You are not allowed to perform this action",
    "details": null
  }
}
```

Required codes:
- `UNAUTHENTICATED`
- `FORBIDDEN`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `CONFLICT`
- `RATE_LIMITED`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

---

## 8) Real-time contract

Transport:
- WebSocket primary (SSE fallback optional).

Minimum events:
- `conversation.created`
- `conversation.updated`
- `member.invited`
- `member.joined`
- `member.left`
- `member.kicked`
- `member.role_changed`
- `message.created`
- `message.deleted`

Event envelope:
```json
{
  "eventId": "evt-123",
  "type": "message.created",
  "occurredAt": "2026-04-27T03:05:00Z",
  "conversationId": "c1",
  "payload": {}
}
```

Rules:
- events must be idempotent by `eventId`
- ordering guaranteed per conversation

---

## 9) Automation requirements (PL7 + institute)

System rules:
1. One singleton `institute` conversation exists.
2. One `division` conversation exists per track.
3. For active personnel:
   - PL7 (level >= 7): active in **all** division conversations.
   - Non-PL7: active only in own division.
   - All active personnel: active in institute conversation.

Trigger events:
- `USER_CREATED`
- `USER_UPDATED` (level/track/status)
- `PERSONNEL_SYNC_COMPLETED`
- `CONVERSATION_CREATED` for division/institute

Implementation must be idempotent (upsert style).

---

## 10) Security requirements

1. Server-side RBAC on every mutation endpoint.
2. Signed auth session/JWT with revocation support.
3. Rate limits:
   - message send
   - invite actions
   - upload actions
4. Attachment security:
   - max file size default 25MB
   - MIME allowlist
   - malware scan async
   - short-lived signed download URL (5 min)
5. Audit mandatory for role/invite/kick/moderation actions.

---

## 11) Observability + operational handover checklist

### Metrics (must expose)
- request count + latency by endpoint
- websocket active connections
- events publish/consume lag
- authz deny rate
- upload blocked-by-scan count

### Logs
- structured logs with `requestId`, `userId`, `conversationId` where relevant

### Alerts
- p95 latency breach
- websocket disconnect spike
- queue lag > threshold
- error rate > threshold

### Runbooks required before go-live
- chat outage
- websocket degradation
- uploads scanning backlog
- DB restore + replay

---

## 12) Delivery plan and definition of done

### Phase A (Foundation)
- DB schema + migrations
- authn/authz middleware
- conversation/member/message CRUD (text)

**DoD A:** FE can run text chat entirely from backend (no localStorage dependency).

### Phase B (Realtime + governance)
- websocket event fanout
- invites/kick/role/leave flows
- audit logs

**DoD B:** FE receives real-time events for message/member changes and governance actions are enforced server-side.

### Phase C (Attachments + security)
- presign/complete/download flows
- scanning pipeline
- rate limits

**DoD C:** FE attachments work end-to-end with security controls.

### Phase D (Automation + hardening)
- PL7/institute workers
- reconciliation cron
- SLO validation + incident drills

**DoD D:** automation is stable and measurable in production-like load.

## 13) Final handover acceptance criteria (BE sign-off)

BE implementation is handover-complete when all are true:
1. API endpoints from Section 6 are implemented and documented.
2. Authorization matrix from Section 5 is enforced by tests.
3. Real-time events from Section 8 are emitted and consumed by FE.
4. Automation rules from Section 9 pass idempotency tests.
5. Error contract from Section 7 is consistently used.
6. Ops checklist from Section 11 is completed.
7. FE smoke test passes with backend enabled (chat send/invite/kick/role/attachment/reply).
